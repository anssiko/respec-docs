  <h2>noLegacyStyle</h2>
  <p>
    A boolean indicating that automatically generated legacy DOM-style sections (Attributes and
    Methods) following the WebIDL blocks are removed. Setting this boolean true brings the document
    style closer to that of used by Anolis. If you are migrating a document that uses the legacy
    DOM-style, you need to manually move the prose from Attributes and Methods sections and put it
    below the IDL markup definition into its own paragraph(s). Additionally, you need to link the
    IDL members back to the prose; ReSpec automatically generates fragment identifiers that start
    with <code>#widl-</code>, and you must manually add corresponding <code>id</code>s to
    appropriate parts in your prose.
